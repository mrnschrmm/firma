Title: Intensive Clean

----

page_description:

From time to time, cleaning must be particularly thorough: despite regular cleaning, some residues or soiling on surfaces adhere particularly stubbornly. A particularly careful treatment is necessary: an intensive care. We help textile or elastic floor coverings, wood and natural stone floors to shine like new again.

With the right treatments the value and the lifetime of the surfaces increases. We are happy to help you to find the optimal spot for your situation.
